	abstract = {The GHap R package was designed to call haplotypes from phased marker data. Given userdeﬁned haplotype blocks (HapBlock), the package identiﬁes the different haplotype alleles (HapAllele) present in the data and scores sample haplotype allele genotypes (HapGenotype) based on HapAllele dose (i.e. 0, 1 or 2 copies). The output is not only useful for analyses that can handle multi-allelic markers, but is also conveniently formatted for existing pipelines intended for bi-allelic markers.},
